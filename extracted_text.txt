Do not use scissors to remove\n\ndressing, as this could possibly cut or damage catheter. Do not suture through any part of\n\nthe catheter. Catheter tubing can tear when subjected to excessive force or rough edges.\n\nUse only smooth jawed forceps for clamping. Clamping the catheter repeatedly in the\n\nsame spot could weaken the tubing. Change the position of the clamp regularly to prolong\n\nthe life of the catheter. Avoid clamping near the adapter and hub of the catheter. Do not\n\nclamp the lumen portion of the catheter. Clamp only the extensions. Examine tubing for\n\ndamage at the end of each treatment.\n\nTape injection caps (or other types used) between treatments to safeguard them against\n\naccidental removal.\n\nIt is recommended that only luer lock (threaded) connections be used with the catheter\n\n(including syringes, IV tubing, and injection caps). Repeated over tightening of syringes,\n\nand caps will reduce connector life and could lead to potential connector failure. Inspect\n\nthe catheter frequently for nicks, scrapes, cuts. etc. which could impair its performance.\n\nThe position of the tip of any central catheter should be verified\n\nAlways be sure that the catheter tip is in the superior vena cava and has not entered into\n\nthe right atrium to avoid possible arrhythmias or mural injury.\n\nUltrasound should be used in the placement of catheters.\n\nDo not use absolute alcohol or acetone based product on the catheter. 2% chlorhexidine\n\nor lodine based solution is recommended as antiseptic solution.\n\nIt is not recommended to use ointments especially antimicrobial ointments or solutions on\n\ncatheters as it may cause its degradation.\n\nOver tightening of catheter luers may lead to its failure.\n\nIf any resistance is felt, then the needle should be pulled out with the wire still inside and\n\nthe procedure repeated. This reduces the risk of entangling of the guide wire or its end\n\nbeing cut off by the needle tip.\n\nThe valve of the guiding syringe should be opened by the guide wire advancer tip.
