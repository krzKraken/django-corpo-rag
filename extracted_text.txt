If resistance is felt during flushing, no further attempt should be\nmade. Further flushing could result in catheter rupture with possible leakage orimmobilization.\nThe pressure CVC is the only catheters to be used for powerful injection. Do not attempt to use\nthe non-pressure multi-lumen catheter in this procedure as it may resuit in catheter rupture\nand high risk to the patient. The correct lumen is marked “PRESSURE” i.e.: Use of lumens not\nmarked “Pressure” for power injection of contrast media may cause failure of the catheter.\nFailure to ensure patency of the catheter prior to power injection studies may result in\ncatheter failure.\n\nFailure to warm contrast media to body temperature prior to power injection may result\nin catheter failure.\n\nPower injector machine pressure limiting feature may not prevent over-pressurization of\nan occluded catheter which may lead to catheter failure.\n\nExceeding the maximum flow rate of 10 ml/sec or the maximum pressure of power injectors\nof 300 p.s.i. may result in catheter failure andor tip dislodgement.\n\nIn the rare event that a hub or connector separates from any component during the\ninsertion or use, take all necessary steps and Precautions to prevent blood loss or air\nembolism and remove the catheter immediately.\n\nThe catheters should not be placed in patient for more than 4 weeks.\n\nOnly physician familiar with the technique should perform the catheter removal.\n\nAlways review hospital protocols, possible complications and their treatments, precautions\nand warning.\n\nDo not use sharp instruments near the extension line or tubing. Do not use scissors to remove\ndressing, as this could possibly cut or damage catheter. Do not suture through any part of\nthe catheter. Catheter tubing can tear when subjected to excessive force or rough edges.\nUse only smooth jawed forceps for clamping. Clamping the catheter repeatedly in the\nsame spot could weaken the tubing. Change the position of the clamp regularly to prolong\nthe life of the catheter. Avoid clamping near the adapter and hub of the catheter. Do not\nclamp the lumen portion of the catheter. Clamp only the extensions. Examine tubing for\ndamage at the end of each treatment.\n\nTape injection caps (or other types used) between treatments to safeguard them against\naccidental removal.\n\nIt is recommended that only luer lock (threaded) connections be used with the catheter\n(including syringes, IV tubing, and injection caps). Repeated over tightening of syringes,\nand caps will reduce connector life and could lead to potential connector failure. Inspect\nthe catheter frequently for nicks, scrapes, cuts, etc. which could impair its performance.\nThe position of the tip of any central catheter should be verified\n\nAlways be sure that the catheter tip is in the superior vena cava and has not entered into\nthe right atrium to avoid possible arrhythmias or mural injury.\n\nUltrasound should be used in the placement of catheters.\n\nDo not use absolute alcohol or acetone based product on the catheter. 2% chlorhexidine\nor lodine based solution is recommended as antiseptic solution.\n\nIt is not recommended to use ointments especially antimicrobial ointments or solutions on\ncatheters as it may cause its degradation.\n\nOver tightening of catheter luers may lead to its failure.\n\nIf any resistance is felt, then the needle should be pulled out with the wire still inside and\nthe procedure repeated. This reduces the risk of entangling of the guide wire or its end\nbeing cut off by the needle tip.\n\nThe valve of the guiding syringe should be opened by the guide wire advancer tip.

The longer the\n\ncatheter is left in, the greater the risks of sepsis and thrombosis .\nSome people suggest changing a catheter every 7 days to reduce the risks of catheter related\nsepsis and thrombosis. However, providing that the catheter is kept clean (sterile injections\nand connections) and there are no signs of systemic sepsis, routine replacement may not be\nnecessary. Repeated cannulation to change lines on a routine basis, rather than based on\nclinical need, can increase the risks to the patient.\n\nCatheter removal\nWarnings:\n\n= Only physician familiar with the technique should attempt the removal.\n* Always review hospital protocols, possible complications and their treatments,\nprecautions and warning.\n\nRemove any dressing and suture material. Ask the patient to take a breath and fully exhale.\nRemove the catheter with a steady pull while the patient is in breath holding and apply firm\npressure to the puncture site for at least 5 minutes to stop the bleeding. Excessive force\nshould not be needed to remove the catheter. If it does not come out, try rotating it whilst\npulling gently. If this still fails, cover it with a sterile dressing and ask an experienced person\nfor advice.\n\nN.B for further information on luer connections, please refer to latest version of BS EN 1SO 80369-7\n\nDescription of marking system\n\nThe catheter tube is marked for effective length in numerical number every 5 centimetres and\ndot every one centimetre however the first 5 cm is not marked.\n\ne ow wf0s 5 ¢ 50w » 2308\n\nRef: TDNV-CVCIFU-I01\nIssue. 7\n\n\n"), Document(metadata={'source': '/home/krzkraken/Escritorio/DEV/django-corpo/docs/AM-CVC.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content=" \n \n \nMarketing Approval \n \n  \nMarketing Approval \n \n  \nRA Approval \n \n \n \n \nDimensions  \nA5 \nRef. \nTD-INV-CVC-IFU-10.1  \nIssue \n \nComments \n \n  \n  [[['Dimensions'], ['A5'], ['Ref.'], ['TD-INV-CVC-IFU-10.1'], ['Issue'], [''], ['Comments'], ['']], [['', 'Marketing Approval', 'Marketing Approval', 'RA Approval']], [['Marketing Approval'], ['']], [['Marketing Approval'], ['']], [['RA Approval'], ['']]]\n[Texto extraído de la imagen en la página 9]:\nAMECATH\n\\_’/,\n\n\n\n[Texto extraído de la imagen en la página 9]:\n\n\n[Texto extraído de la imagen en la página 9]:\n\n\n[Texto extraído de la imagen en la página 9]:\nDesigned by:\n\nl T ]\n&W Marketing Approval Marketing Approval RA Approval\n\ncHlatirzowed\n\n\n[Texto extraído de la imagen en la página 9]:\nAMECATH Instructions for use\n~_\n\nProduct Variants:\n\nFor variants of AMECATH Central Venous Catheters , Kindly refer to the catalogue, visit our\nwebsite on “www.amecathgroup.com”, or contact your nearest AMECATH representative.\n\n1.
